Fav Places to Eat in Toronto
============================

I created a Google map representation of my favourite places to eat in Toronto (fav-places.html). This involved using markers, information windows, geolocators to locate restaurants using addresses, and geolocation to determine the location of the user.

The rest of the html files in this repository helped me learn how to do the following with the Google Maps API:

- create a Google map;
- add a marker to a map; and
- add an information window to a marker on a map.
